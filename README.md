# Movie-Rating-Prediction

**This project leverages several powerful Python libraries to predict movie ratings based on various features. Using pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis, we process and clean the dataset to prepare it for modeling. NumPy is utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays, ensuring optimized performance during computations. For data visualization, matplotlib and seaborn are employed to create insightful plots and graphs that help in understanding data distributions, correlations, and patterns. These visualizations play a crucial role in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, enabling us to identify key trends and relationships within the data. The combination of these libraries facilitates a comprehensive and systematic approach to developing an accurate and reliable movie rating prediction model.**
